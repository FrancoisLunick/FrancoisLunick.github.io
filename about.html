                        <p>Hi, I'm Lunick Francois, a dedicated and passionate individual with a diverse set of interests and achievements. 
                            The gym is like my second home, where I enjoy working out and staying fit. Writing poetry is another passion of 
                            mine, and I have published a poetry book titled "The Whisper in the Void." I have also developed several iOS apps 
                            that were featured in the App Store.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I served in the U.S. Navy for four years, gaining invaluable experience and discipline. My educational journey includes 
                            a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Full Sail University, obtained in March 2022, an Associate's in Information Technology 
                            in February 2024, and I am on track to earn my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity by February 2025. I also plan to pursue a Master's 
                            in Cybersecurity in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Learning new things comes naturally to me, and I have a knack for quickly picking up new skills. I love coding and often work 
                            on programming projects in my spare time. Playing basketball and hanging out with friends are some of my favorite pastimes. 
                            Additionally, I have taught myself to play the piano by ear, which showcases my ability to learn and master new talents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am deeply passionate about everything I do, whether it's in my professional or personal life. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, 
                            and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and accomplishments.
